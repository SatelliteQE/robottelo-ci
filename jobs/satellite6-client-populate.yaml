        <p>Job that installs (if SERVER_HOSTNAME not provided) and populates or just populates an already installed <strong>Satellite 6</strong> on a machine. This job imports manifest, syncs RHEL content, creates CV, Publishes it, promotes it, Creates Ak for different architectures and finally triggers beaker job.</p>

                This is a dummy re-run, any changes done to the parameters during the re-run would have no effect.
                Check this if the script transferred to sat6 failed for some reason and you want
                to RERUN it, after fixing or skiping of the command in the script.
                Would skip already run hammer commands and would proceed to the next TODO command.
