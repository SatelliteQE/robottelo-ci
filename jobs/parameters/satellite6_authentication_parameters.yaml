            description: |
                Enrolls Sat6 to IDM and configures External Authentication using IDM as the Auth source.
                Requires the same Sat6 and IDM Server domain, to work out of the box.
                The Sat6 Server's first nameserver should be pointing to the IDM Server.
                One can use test-external-auth VM to test this feature quickly.
                This will be useful for testing Kerberos/SSO, 2FA, e.t.c features with IDM.
                Please note, this is not LDAP Authentication.

                The Sat6 Server's first nameserver should be pointing to the AD Server.
