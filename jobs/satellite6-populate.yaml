                The chosen download policy will override the installation download policy on your satellite.
                Immediate is the default choice for this job as this is more stable option.

                Currently no other repo is configured to sync apart from the above mentioned in satellite6-populate-template.sh.
                One can add support to enable and sync repos like, RHEL5, X86, workstation and so on when MINIMAL_INSTALL is false
                under satellite6-populate-template.sh script.
