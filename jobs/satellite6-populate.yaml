        <p>Job that just Populates an already installed <strong>Satellite 6</strong> on a machine. This job imports manifest, syncs RHEL content, creates CV, Publishes it, promotes it, Creates Ak, Creates Host-Groups and finally Creates Hosts on Libvirt.</p>

                Check this if the script transferred to sat6 failed for some reason and you want
                to RERUN it, after fixing or skiping of the command in the script.
                Would skip already run hammer commands and would proceed to the next TODO command.

                The chosen download policy will override the installation download policy on your satellite.
                Immediate is the default choice for this job as this is more stable option.

                One can add support to enable and sync repos like, RHEL5, X86, workstation and so on when MINIMAL_INSTALL is false
