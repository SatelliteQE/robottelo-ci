            description: |
                Specify whether you want Satellite6 to be populated with content and/or install & configure capsule.
                Please note, capsule installation would first populate content and then install and configure capsule.
        - string:
            name: INTERFACE
            description: |
                Default value is virbr1 if not specified. Leave it blank if using a
                beaker machine for sat6 or any sat6 machine which has a DHCP IP.
                Used for --foreman-proxy-dns-interface and --foreman-proxy-dhcp-interface installer options.
                Helpful in configuring sat6 where the interface needed to configure is
                eth0(feature vm's on rhev), eno33559296(vmware). Otherwise this is Optional.
        - string:

            description: |
                Default value is '192.168.100.1', which is automatically set by installer job.
                Used for, --foreman-proxy-dhcp-gateway and --foreman-proxy-dns-reverse installer options.
                If using isolated vlans explicitly specify the gateway here, which would be in the format
                'zz.xx.yy.254'. Mandatory if installing sat6 which has isolated VLANs, Otherwise this is Optional.
        - string:
            name: SUBNET
            description: |
                Default value is '192.168.100.0', which is automatically set by installer job.
                Used to define subnet that is operated by Satellite's internal capsule.
                Mandatory if installing sat6 which has isolated VLANs, Otherwise this is Optional.
        - string:
            name: NETMASK
            description: |
                Default value is '255.255.255.0', which is automatically set by installer job.
                Used to define subnet that is operated by Satellite's internal capsule.
                Mandatory if installing sat6 which has isolated VLANs, Otherwise this is Optional.
        - string:
            name: DHCP_RANGE
            description: |
                This is required when we need to set a custom DHCP range operated by internal capsule.
                Completely Optional but would be helpful to have.
        - string:
            name: INSTALLER_OPTIONS
            description: |
                Can pass katello-installer options. Helpful to quickly
                configure ad-hoc stuff without the need to have each installer
                option separately. This is not validated in any way, so the
                user needs to provide valid input.
                For example: foreman-websockets-encrypt=false,capsule-reverse-proxy=true,no-lock-package-versions,disable-system-checks.
                Do not specify these installer options related to (Interface, Gateway, DNS, DHCP, TFTP, PUPPET)
                here, these are already handled.
        - string:
            name: OS_UPGRADE_REPOS
            description: |
                Upgrade OS using this repo URL(s), typically RHEL candidate repo.
                This can be space-separated list of repos' URLs to specify multiple repos.

            name: EXTERNAL_AUTH
            choices:
                - 'NO_AUTH'
                - 'IDM'
                - 'AD'
            description: |
                Enrolls Sat6 to IDM or AD and configures External Authentication using IDM or AD as the Auth source.
                Requires the same Sat6 and IDM or AD Server domain, to work out of the box.
                The Sat6 Server's first nameserver should be pointing to the IDM Server.
                One can use test-external-auth VM to test this feature quickly for IDM EXTERNAL_AUTH
                One can use the Windows AD VM itself to test this feature quickly for AD EXTERNAL_AUTH
                This will be useful for testing Kerberos/SSO, 2FA, e.t.c features with IDM or AD.
                Please note, this is not LDAP Authentication.
        - bool:
            name: IDM_REALM
            default: false
            description: |
                Enrolls sat6 to IDM and configures Sat6 for REALM Integration.
                Requires the same Sat6 and IDM Server domain, to work out of the box.
                The Sat6 Server's first nameserver should be pointing to the IDM Server.
                This is also called, External Authentication for Provisioned Hosts.
